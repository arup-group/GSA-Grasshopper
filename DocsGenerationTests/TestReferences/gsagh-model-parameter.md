## Description

A GSA model is the main parameter that associates with a GSA model file. Data and results can be extracted from an opened model. A model contains all the constituent parts (Properties, Elements/Members, Loads, Cases, Tasks, etc). Use the [Create Model](gsagh-create-model-component.md) or [Analyse Model](gsagh-analyse-model-component.md) components to assemble a new Model or use the [Open Model](gsagh-open-model-component.md) to work with an existing Model. You can use the [Get Model Properties](gsagh-get-model-properties-component.md) or [Get Model Geometry](gsagh-get-model-geometry-component.md) to start editing the objects from an existing model.

If the model has been analysed you can use the [Select Result](gsagh-select-result-component.md) component to explore the Models structural performance and behaviour.
