## Description

Elements in GSA are geometrical objects used for Analysis. Elements must be split at intersections with other elements to connect to each other or 'node out'. 

Element1Ds are one-dimensional stick elements (representing [1D Element Types](/references/element-types.md#element-types)) used by the solver for analysis.
