## Description

[Members](/references/hidr-data-member.md) in GSA are geometrical objects used in the Design Layer. Members can automatically intersection with other members. Members are as such more closely related to building objects, like a beam, column, slab or wall. Elements can automatically be created from Members used for analysis. 

 A Member1D is the linear geometry resembling for instance a column or a beam. They can be defined geometrically by a PolyCurve consisting of either multiple line segments or a single arc.
